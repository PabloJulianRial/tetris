# TETRIS

While not incredibly original, as this is probably the most versioned game in history, I chosed to create my own version of it as a form of tribute to the legendary, geometrical, immersive, russian vibed, fast paced, mind streatching, retro-vintage, annoyingly musicalizised, all timer , TETRIS.
It took humanity 37 years to complete it, I hope mine takes longer.
